## What is Dopamine Jailbreak?
Dopamine is a semi-untethered jailbreak tool for A8-A16 and M1-M2 devices running iOS and iPadOS 15.0-16.6.1. The lead developer of this tool, Lars Fröder (@opa334dev), formally released Dopamine v2. This perma-signable jailbreak tool is an open-source project with two popular Default package managers, Sileo and Zebra. Also, you can install Cydia through Sileo, but Cydia has not been updated for a long time. 

**In simpler terms, a semi-Untethered jailbreak requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot. The term 'perma-signable' means that users can permanently sign IPAs on jailbroken/non-jailbroken iDevices 14.0-14.8.1 & 15.0-15.1.1, with the help of the CoreTrust bug.

It's important to note that the 'Rootless' feature of this jailbreak tool means that it does not provide full access to the iOS device's operating system; it can only be written to certain parts of the filesystem. This means that most Cydia tweaks are not supported with this jailbreak tool, and you may need to use only rootless support tweaks for the best performance.

### What are the benefits of installing Dopamine Jailbreak?
Most users jailbreak their iDevices to customize and keep the iPhone charming and beautiful. The main reason is to patch the security bug in that iOS version. After jailbreaking your device, you can install appropriate security patches and keep your iPhone safe from hackers accessing unauthorized data.

Also, there are many more tweaks by professional jailbreak tweak developers that still need to be added to the Apple system, with new features and functions that help you ease your daily life. 

Nowadays, most of the new iOS 18 features come from old tweaks created by developers who built tweak ideas for iOS 14 and lower. 

Dopamine v2 is based on the Kernel File Descriptor (KFD) exploit and a newer PPL bypass. Currently, Dopamine v2 officially supports the following device and firmware combinations:
